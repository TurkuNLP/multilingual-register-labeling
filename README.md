# Multilingual modeling of registers

This repository includes the following folders, including annotations and code used in the papers described below. Please cite these papers if you use these resources!

#### A transformers Classifier 
Using Huggingface model repository and TF2/keras, developed by Rönnqvist et al. (2021)

#### EACL21-code 
Code used to develop the register identification systems applied in Rönnqvist et al. (2021)

#### Multilingual register annotations
* FreCORE and SvCORE: register annotations in French and Swedish, developed by Repo et al. (2020) and applied by Rönnqvist et al. (2022)
* Register annotations in eight further languages, developed by Laippala et al. (2022)

#### Text quality annotations
Applied and developed by Laippala et al. (2022) and Salmela (2022).
