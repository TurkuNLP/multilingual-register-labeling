We've got to get the tight ends making plays where the linebackers are concerned about something more than just the run.\"", "That's been the problem in recent years for the Vikings, who have handed off to Peterson 1,118 times since 2010 and used six quarterbacks while going 24-39-1 with one wild-card playoff exit and two head coaching changes in that span.", "Peterson ran for 2,097 yards in his 2012 MVP season.

Peterson's career high is 43.", "\"He's going to catch passes,\" Turner said. \"You've got to try to utilize all the guys that can make plays, and I think you need to be able to run the ball in this league.

The first two are mysteries but the last two are actually in the Middle East.", "But at one time a case was made that Serpent Mound in Adams County \u2014 southwest Ohio\u2019s greatest example of land art and one of the nation\u2019 best known earthworks \u2014 was indeed the actual Garden of Eden. And the story of that theory, as well as a lot of others about the Garden\u2019s actual location, are discussed in a delightfully provocative and well-researched recent book, Brook Wilensky-Lanford\u2019s Paradise Lust: Searching for the Garden of Eden. Some of those theories are flawed but thoughtful and even scholarly; others are breathtakingly half-baked.", "It\u2019s been established that Ohio\u2019s famous 1,348-foot-long raised effigy of a serpent was constructed by ancient American Indian cultures. Why has yet to be firmly decided. It might have been used as a calendar; the fact that the coiled serpent\u2019s open mouth points toward an oval shape has been taken as a symbol of fertility, or as a sanctuary where people could gather during solar eclipses.", "As Wilensky-Lanford recounts, however, an Adams County native, Reverend Edmund Landon West, first claimed in 1901 that it was actually the true, God-created Garden of Eden. After all, the serpent was the one that gave Eve the forbidden fruit with disastrous results. And here was that serpent! Not only that, but three branches of Brush Creek flow nearby.", "It\u2019s worth noting that Serpent Mound had already been well-studied by 1901, and neither Ohio nor America was a superstitious place. Harvard University\u2019s Peabody Museum had undertaken a restoration of the mound and then given it to the Ohio Historical Society a year before West\u2019s theory was voiced. So he was seen as an oddity at the time.", "Wilensky-Lanford, who has read West\u2019s 18-page pamphlet Eden\u2019s Land and Garden With Their Marks Yet to Be Seen (I have not) says his theory turns on a couple key points: He didn\u2019t believe the mound\u2019s builders could have been Indians. \u201cHe believed the Mound Builders were America\u2019s first people: Christian people who \u2018most assuredly\u2019 knew something of the Bible events recorded in Serpent Mound,\u201d she writes. In fact, she says of West\u2019s theory, humans from Adam through Noah lived in Ohio until the Great Flood, when he built his Ark on the Mississippi River and then traveled 48 miles a day (or 7,500 miles in five months) from the Gulf of Mexico to Mount Ararat in Armenia.", "This theory is enjoyable yet silly. But it sounds downright scientific compared to another theory that Wilensky-Lanford mentions, Dr. George C. Allen\u2019s 19th Century belief that the Garden of Eden started off at the North Pole but rotated around the world every 25,000 years until coming to rest \u2014 at that time \u2014 under Cincinnati. So start digging.", "If only another Cincinnati-area connection \u2014 a museum \u2014 to the Garden of Eden that Wilensky-Lanford mentions were so amusing. But her extensive consideration of the anti-evolution, science-denying Fundamentalism manifested at Northern Kentucky\u2019s Creation Museum actually is quite sobering and troubling. While many people view the place as kitsch, she doesn\u2019t. That museum is based on a literal reading of the Bible and its Book of Genesis.", "Visiting the museum in 2008, Wilensky-Lanford walks through its Garden of Eden exhibit. \u201cEach new scene came with a placard matter-of-factly stating biblical interpretation as if it were an explanatory caption,\u201d she writes. Yet, amid all the literalism, she notes the exhibit never states exactly where the actual Garden might have been.", "Then it hits her \u2014 admitting that a Garden of Eden ever could have existed on earth would defeat the point of the evangelism: to prepare Fundamentalist Christians for perfection in heaven \u2014 a new Garden \u2014 after the rapture.", "\u201cAs ideas about the Garden go, I found this empty, invisible Eden disappointing,\u201d she writes of the exhibit. \u201c(Other proposed locations), however far-fetched, were human. \u2026The Creation Museum\u2019s empty Eden brought to my mind \u2026 coldness.\u201d \u201cAs ideas about the Garden go, I found this empty, invisible Eden disappointing,\u201d she writes of the exhibit. \u201c(Other proposed locations), however far-fetched, were human. \u2026The Creation Museum\u2019s empty Eden brought to my mind \u2026 coldness.\u201d", "Adam and Eve would probably prefer Serpent Mound to the Creation Museum, based on Wilensky-Lanford\u2019s description.", "CONTACT STEVEN ROSEN: srosen@citybeat.com", "Read the Digital Print Issue"], "labels": ["1", "1", "1", "1", "1", "1", "1", "1", "1", "1", "1", "1", "1", "1", "1", "1", "1", "1", "0"]}, {"text": ["Looking for sex?

Last year, the House refused to go along with a Senate-passed bill that would have made clear that lesbians, gays, immigrants and Native American women should have equal access to Violence Against Women Act programs.", "It appeared the scenario would be repeated this year when the House introduced a bill that didn\u2019t mention the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and watered down a Senate provision allowing tribal courts to prosecute non-Indians who attack their Indian partners on tribal lands.", "House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., who has spent months working on the issue, defended the Republican plan: \u201cOur goal in strengthening the Violence Against Women Act is simple.

Obama won 55 percent of the women\u2019s vote last November. Republican presidential candidates haven\u2019t won the women\u2019s vote since 1984, when Ronald Reagan held a 12-point lead over Walter Mondale among women.", "The anti-violence bill should never have become partisan, said Sen.
