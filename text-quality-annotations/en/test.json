All in all, the hotel is a more than adequate accomodation. The room that I stayed in (202) has a stunning view of the bay and the city and was very quiet. The room is sparsely decorated and furnished, but every thing was in good repair (well the bathroom sink was a bit slow draining....).

The rooms stairstep up the hillside of the complex. It is a relatively short (15 min) walk to Caletta beach and probably a bit longer up the hill and over to La Quebrada and the divers. The hotel was not very busy during the four days I stayed, which suited me fine. Drawbacks may include the fact that the hotel isn't located near a restaurant or nightlife, but the buses and taxies whizzing by can easily take you to the Zocalo and the Costera in a jiffy. Also, be prepared to haul your bags over the brick patio and up the brick stairs. You can probably get someone to move them to your room, but I didn't notice a large staff. I did notice by the signage that it is/was a Hyatt hotel. However, they don't appear to be putting much money into it as the spa and restaurant were closed during my visit. Perhaps they operate during busier times. All in all, a fine hotel well landscaped and quiet with a wonderful view of the bay.
